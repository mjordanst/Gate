The ECAT library is very old, originally written in the early nineties of the
20th century.  The ecat.tar.gz tar ball was distributed for many years by the
OpenGATE collaboration, separately from the Gate code base, to be compiled
separately by interested users. This was because there is no maintainer for
this ECAT code. We are now (January 2021) including ECAT in the "external"
section of our source code. We still do not officially support/maintain this
code, but we do provide a CMake file that aims to free the useres of the burden
of compiling and linking this very ancient code.

The ECAT code as it is available to the OpenGATE collaboration is stored in
the source/externals/ecat/src directory, with a small change (see below).

If you plan to use and/or distribute this code, please see the copyright notice
in source/externals/ecat/src/copyright.

It looks like the code is not quite complete: the copyright notice mentions
a "docs" directory, which is missing. If anyone can provide us with a complete
source code archive that is compliant with the wishes of the original author,
that would be wonderful.

The copyright notice demands that we distribute this code without any changes.
However, I had to make two small changes in order to make it compile on my
system, namely to rename "cfree" to "free" in src/rtsacs.c and in
src/rts_cmd.c, because the linker did not recognize "cfree", even though the
man pages say that "cfree" is just a synonym for "free".
